# Dockerfile.ollama
# Use the official Ollama image as the base
FROM ollama/ollama:latest

# Define the model you want to pull (e.g., the small 2B parameter Gemma)
# ENV MODEL_NAME=gemma:2b

# Run the pull command during the build process
# This bakes the model into the image layer, making it instantly available at runtime.
# RUN ollama serve

# The default entrypoint will still start the Ollama server
